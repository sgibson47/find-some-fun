# Find Some Fun

## About 

This app was created to practice using React and querying APIs.

It allows users to query the Eventbrite API for events matching the keywords and event category they provide and then displays the results of their search.  

## Demo

download the respository:
in your terminal, 

run `git clone git@github.com:sgibson47/find-some-fun.git`

get it running:
in your terminal, 

run `npm install`

run `npm start`

If it doesn't happen automatically, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in the browser and start finding some fun!
